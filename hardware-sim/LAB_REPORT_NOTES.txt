LAB_REPORT_NOTES

Block equivalents to your Simulink design:
- Sine components: delta/theta/sigma rhythms used in sleep staging.
- Noise: electrode + biological background + environment.
- Summation: scalp electrode records a mixture of sources.
- Amplify (GAIN): models the EEG instrumentation amplifier/preamplifier stage.
- High-pass (0.5 Hz): removes drift/electrode polarization.
- Low-pass (40 Hz): reduces EMG and high-frequency noise.
- Band-pass filters: isolate sleep bands for feature extraction.
- PSD and spectrogram: frequency-domain views used in sleep analysis.

Suggested report figures:
1) Raw EEG (uV) vs time
2) After gain + HP/LP vs time
3) Delta/theta/sigma band outputs vs time
4) PSD before and after filtering
5) Spectrogram of the processed signal
